			<h3 class="caption">Introduction to Recipe Rating System Chart</h3>
			<p>In order to better help you identify recipes that feature a high concentration of nutrients for the
				calories they contain, we created a Recipe Rating System. This system allows us to highlight the
				recipies that are especially rich in particular nutrients. THe following chart shows the
				nutrients for which 15-Minute Greek Garbanzo Bean Salad is either an excellent, very good,
				or good source (below the chart you will find a table that explains these qualifications).
				If a nutrient is not listed in the chart, it does not necessarily mean that the recipe
				doesn't contain it. It simply means that the nutrient is not provided in a sufficient amount 
				or concentration to meet our rating criteria. (To view this recipie's in-depth nutritional 
				profile that includes values for dozens of nutrients - not just the ones rated as excellent, 
				very good, or good - please use the link below the chart.) To read this chart accurately, you'll
				need to glance back up to see the ingredients used in the recipe and the number of serving 
				sizes provided by the recipe. Our nutrient ratings are based on a single serving. For example, 
				if a recipe makes 4 servings, you would be receiving the nutrient amounts listed in the 
				chart by eating 1/4th of the combined ingredients found in the recipe. Now, returning 
				to the chart itself, you can look next to the nutrient name in order to find the nutrient 
				amount it offers, the percent Daily Value (DV%) that this amount represents, the nutrient 
				density that we calculated for this recipe and nutrient, and the rating we established in
				our rating system. For most of our nutrient ratings, we adopted the government standards 
				for food labeling that are found in the U.S. Food and Drug Administratin's "Reference Values 
				for Nutrition Labeling." <a href="http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=faq&#38;dbid=22">Read more background informatino and details of our rating system</a>.</p>
